This repository is intended to be cloned/forked in order to set up a working jsPsych experiment via GitHub pages. This makes it simple to start exploring jsPsych.

**This project currently uses jsPsych v3.1**

Instructions
------------

1. You will need a GitHub account in order to use the GitHub hosting feature. [Register for free](http://www.github.com).

2. After you are logged into your account, click the "fork" button near the top right corner of the page. This will automaticaly copy the repository into your GitHub account. Once the copy is complete, you will be sent directly to your copy of this repository.

3. At this point, you must make a small change to the repository to trigger a fresh build of the website. Any change will work. For example, you could change the information in the `<title></title>` section of index.html to give your experiment a new title. 

4. After you have made a change, you can try the test experiment by going to http://[your GitHub username].github.io/jsPsych-quickstart/. It can take a few minutes for GitHub to create this page the first time, so you may need to wait up to 10 minutes before this works. 

That's all! Once the website is working, you can edit the files in the repository and the changes will show up immediately at the above URL. 

#### A few more advanced notes

1. The repository has two branches, master and gh-pages. Both have the same content, but only changes made to the gh-pages branch will affect the website. The gh-pages branch is marked as the default branch, so you don't need to change any settings if you are editing the page using the GitHub interface.

2. Renaming the repository will change the URL.
